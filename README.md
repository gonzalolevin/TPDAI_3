# General Information
### What is the purpose of the project?
This project was carried out within the framework of a school subject called "Development of information systems", in order for us to learn the process of developing an API, and using the Node.js and Express technologies.
### What does the project do?
This project exposes the information of many movies and their related characters, giving the user the opportunity to interact with this information in many ways, such as:
- Getting an array with all the Movies/Characters and their related information.
- Getting the information of a specific movie/character by its ID.
- Posting a new movie/character to the database.
- Updating an already existing movie/character to the database.
- Deleting a movie/character from the database.
- Filtering through all of the movies/characters to find the ones mathing with your specifications.
### What technologies are used?
The technologies used were mainly Node.js and Express.
Node.js provides a powerful environment for building APIs, it offers several features that make it an excellent choice for API development.
Express provides a minimalist framework for building APIs, making API development more straightforward with its features.

The best way to try said functinalities is by using the Postamn application, which is a popular API development tool that enables developers to streamline the process of testing, documenting, and interacting with APIs.
### Postman Usage
- Open the postman application.
- Press the "New" button. <img width="278" alt="postman new" src="https://github.com/gonzalolevin/TPDAI_3/assets/90118986/fb4aafea-d026-4591-814c-007ae5b8a4fb">

## Using each endpoint

You will appreciate that many endpoints can be tried out:
